# Various

Simple ActionPack::Variant configuration for Rails 4.1.

Rails 4.1 introduces to **Action Pack Variants** which make it
dramatically easier to tailor your views to serve the most relevant
content for specific device categories.

According to the [Rails documentation](http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/MimeResponds.html#method-i-respond_to), formats can have
different variants, settable in a `before_action`:

    request.variant = :tablet if request.user_agent =~ /iPad/

You respond to variants just as you would to formats:

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html               # /app/views/:controller/:action.html.erb
      format.html.tablet        # /app/views/:controller/:action.html+tablet.erb
    end

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'various'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install various

## Usage

Various allows you to easily configure a mapping of user agent regular
expressions which will set the `request.variant` automagically based on
whether or not there was a match from `request.user_agent`.

All you have to do in your controller is the following:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Various::Controller
    end

And in an initializer, say `/config/initializers/various.rb`:

    Various.configure do |config|
      config.variant_map = {
        /iPad/   => :tablet,
        /iPhone/ => :mobile
      }
    end

But these are the defaults, for now, so this would be unnecessary unless
you would want to change the hash map to something other than the above.

It is really that simple!
